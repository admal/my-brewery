## Technology
The app was developed using Angular and Supabase (supabase database). In the future Supabase will be the chosen technology for API with storage and authentication.

## Planned features
* accounts - authorisation and authentication
* more alcohol types - beer was chosen to be the main theme of the application because that is the theme of Hacktoberfest but primarly we are making wines and spirits and we want to use My Brewery for all of our productions
* notifications - calendar, email, sms notifications to notify whether you need to take action
* better recipies - more complex ingredients and recipy stages
